Hello All,

Creating this as i need help regarding my project for work, where am creating an app using C# & WPF in VS2022, I am using Selenium to automate some of the browser usage from app.

Regarding code above in the first screenshot I was reading some blogs and found that " options.AddArgument("--remote-debugging-pipe"); " is used to resolve the issue with DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist which is 2nd screenshot.

But when I use that I get different issue and that is that session times out like in the 3rd screenshot 

Does anyone have any idea how can I resolve this as I need to automate ticket creation.

Thank you in advance 🙇‍♂️
